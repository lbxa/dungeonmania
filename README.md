## The Game

In Dungeon Mania you control a Player and have to complete various goals within a series of dungeons to complete the game!

The simplest form of such a puzzle is a maze, where the Player must find their way from the starting point to the exit.

More advanced puzzles may contain things like boulders that need to be pushed onto floor switches, enemies that need to be fought with weapons, or collectables like potions and treasure.
